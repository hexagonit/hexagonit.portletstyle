TODO
====

* use in the wild
* pipe delimited @@portletstyles control panel configlet so we have
  human-readable styles (id, title)
* document how to use GS to import styles with a third-party product
* maybe patch non-editable portlets (login, calendar, search, etc.)
* check how `collective.weightedportlets` patches portlets and learn from it
